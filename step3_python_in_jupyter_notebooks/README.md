Good work! :clap: Now we're ready to start coding in in Jupyter Notebooks. Codeacademy was an ideal learning space that offered you immediate feedback on your code, but now you are on your own! This next section goes over essential tools and resources that you will use while you are coding.

This includes:
1. Navigating Jupyter Notebooks
2. Getting packages into your Jupyter Notebook
3. Data previews vs. saved variables
4. Deciphering error messages
5. Tips on reading documentation

For this step, and from now on, you'll work through workbooks that are Jupyter Notebooks full of instruction and guidance. Please experiment! If you ever wonder "what would happen if I did this?", try it and see what happens! Experimentation, making mistakes, and figuring out what went wrong is a huge part of the learning process.

## To get started...
You want to open the workbook in JupyterLab. To open the workbook in JupyterLab:
1. Open Anaconda.
2. Open JupyterLab.
3. Use the file navigator on the left to find the `workbook.ipynb` in the `step3_python_in_jupyter_notebooks` folder.
4. When you open the workbook file, you may see a pop-up that says "Select Kernel". A **kernel** is your coding environment. You should select `python_for_uxr_env`. This is the coding environment that you set up in Step 1.

## When you're done...
Head to step 4: [Click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/python_for_uxr/tree/master/step4_clean_your_data) to see the step 4 instructions online. You can also open up the instructions on your computer by navigating to the `step4_clean_your_data` folder and opening the `offline_README.pdf`
