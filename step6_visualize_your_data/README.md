# Step 6: Visualize Your Data
Now the data is clean and you've begun to understand the nuances of your dataset.  At this point you should have completed the following sections:

Remeber the rule of thumb for data analysis...

**statistical tests should only be used to confirm the significance of patterns that you can plainly see in your data.**

While summarizing our data in tables is a great first pass, and can be much faster and easier than visualization, the best way to understand our data is to visualize it!

Also, once we've pulled the key insights from our data, tables are a terrible way to communicate ideas to stakeholders. Data visualizations are the most powerful way to communicate key insight from data. Good visualization will help convince stakeholders that your insights are valuable because you'll be able to show them **patterns that they can plainly see in the data.**

## How you are going to visualize your data
People have very strong opinions about what packages are best for data visualization and there are a lot of them - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, bokeh etc. - and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. Here I am going to teach you how to use quicklook. [quicklook](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook) is a data visualization package that I built to try and make simple data visualization faster and easier to learn - it's all copy-and-paste! It is very restricted in what it can do (there are only 8 main functions!); however, I have found that I can use those 8 functions to meet 95% of my data visualization needs.

## Prerequisites
I recommend taking 5 minutes to reach through the basic documentation of quicklook to understand how it works.
- [Right click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/tree/master/how_to_use_quicklook#how-to-use-quicklook) to open `how to use quicklook` in a new tab
- [Right click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/copy_and_paste_quicklook_code.md) to open `tips for using quicklook in Jupyter Notebooks`

## To get started...
You want to open the workbook in JupyterLab. To open the workbook in JupyterLab:
1. Open Anaconda.
2. Open JupyterLab.
3. Use the file navigator on the left to find the `step6_workbook.ipynb` in the `step6_visualize_your_data` folder.
4. When you open the workbook file, you may see a pop-up that says "Select Kernel". A **kernel** is your coding environment. You should select `python_for_uxr_env`. This is the coding environment that you set up in Step 1.

## When you're done...
That's it! You will hopefully have all of the resources and basic skills to begin digging into your data. Keep working at it and stay organized! As a researcher, you'll be able to save massive amounts of time for you and your team by applying your Python skillset to your workflow.

If you want to take your skills to the next level, I would strongly recommend the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. The first edition is [free on Github](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) or you can [purchase the second edition here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/).
