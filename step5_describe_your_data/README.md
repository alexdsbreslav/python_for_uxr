# Step 5: Understand your data
Now you've learned the incredibly important step of how to clean and manipulate your data. You are a data wrangler or a small-scale [analytics engineer](https://medium.com/spotify-insights/analytics-engineering-at-spotify-f165180a6722)! You can now take raw messy data from programs like Qualtrics, dScout, or UserZoom and transform it into a treasure trove, waiting to be examined for key insights. At this point you should have completed the following sections:

- Step 2: Learn Python Basics :white_check_mark:
- Step 3: Python in Jupyter Notebooks :white_check_mark:
- Step 4: Clean Your Data :white_check_mark:

Now that you have clean data, it is time to start examining it to see what insight it holds!

:warning: I want to urge patience at this moment! :warning: 

It can be hard to not just jump right into the exciting parts: running correlations, t-tests, chi-square tests, or regressions to test every hunch or hypotheses you have about our data.  There are countless examples in statistics textbooks, Medium articles, and wherever people talk about data analysis about why jumping into statistical testing too early can mislead you!

The rule of thumb that I live by is...

**statistical tests should only be used to confirm the significance of patterns that you can plainly see in your data.**

So to understand our data, we don't want to blindly run statistical tests! Rather...

**we want to use functions that summarize and describe the features of our data to determine if interesting patterns exist.**

## Prerequisite
Before starting this section, it is important to have a basic understanding of data types (e.g. categorical vs. continuous) and how different data types should can summarized. [Right-click here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-types-in-statistics-347e152e8bee) to open to brief tutorial on data types in a new tab.

## To get started...
You want to open the workbook in JupyterLab. To open the workbook in JupyterLab:
1. Open Anaconda.
2. Open JupyterLab.
3. Use the file navigator on the left to find the `step5_workbook.ipynb` in the `step5_understand_your_data` folder.
4. When you open the workbook file, you may see a pop-up that says "Select Kernel". A **kernel** is your coding environment. You should select `python_for_uxr_env`. This is the coding environment that you set up in Step 1.

## When you're done...
[Click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/python_for_uxr/tree/master/step6_visualize_your_data) to see the step 6 instructions online. You can also open up the instructions on your computer by navigating to the `step6_vizualize_your_data` folder and opening the `offline_README.pdf`
