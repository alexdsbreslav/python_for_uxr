# Step 1: Download Tools
Before we do anything, we need to set up your computer with the appropriate applications, accounts, and settings.

## Download Anaconda :snake:
[Click on this link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to head to the website. When you are there, download Anaconda using the 64-Bit Graphical Installer.
### What is Anaconda?
Anaconda creates a home for coding on your computer. When you open Anaconda Navigator on your computer, it is like opening the Applications tab on your finder. When you want to start coding, you'll open Anaconda Navigator and, from there, start up JupyterLab.
### What is JupyterLab?
JupyterLab is the application that you will be doing all of your coding in. JupyterLab is an application, which you will use to interact with your data - in this way, JupyterLab is equivalent to Excel. However, JupyterLab is different from Excel in one very important way: in Excel, you make changes to you data by hand; in JupyterLab, you are writing Python code so that your computer will makes changes to the data for you.

## Create a GitHub account :octocat:
[Click on this link](https://github.com/) to head to GitHub to create an account.
### Why do I need a GitHub account?
I want you to download everything on this website on to your computer (it's a bunch of folders, Jupyter Notebooks, and text files).

## Create a copy of this GitHub repo on your computer.
On GitHub, collections of files and folders is a called a repository or **repo**. This repo is called `python_for_uxr`. I want you to download this repo on to your computer. When you do, you'll have a perfect copy of everything that is online. 

To copy this repo to your computer, you'll **fork** it. Fork is just a GitHub word for create a copy on to your computer. 


**Step 2**  
NEEDS README
Get this repository on your computer and synced with your GitHub account.
Fork this repository to your GitHub, clone it to your computer.

**Step 3**  
`set_up_environments.md`: directions for how to get Anaconda and JupyterLab set up after you've downloaded everything

## Presentations
`tools.pdf`: slide deck from our first module that introduces Anaconda, JupyterLab, and GitHub

## Other
`coding_environment.yml`: this is our coding environment file. See `set_up_environments.md` for how to use this file
