# Hi! :wave: Welcome to my python tutorial for UX researchers

I believe that the core functions of a user researcher are to design research studies, interact with users, and derive insights from those interactions. However, many parts of the user research process are hands-on, time consuming, and not reproducible. These issues are exacerbated as research scales; when researchers want to ask more people more questions, the data can quickly get unwieldy. Researchers may spend the majority of their time on a project doing tasks like cleaning or managing data by hand.

This is where Python and Jupyter Notebooks comes in. Python and Jupyter Notebooks are incredibly powerful tools that have the ability to drastically improve your research processes and day-to-day life. **My goal here is to help user researchers get started working with data in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.** 

Learning Python, or learning how to program in any language, can seem overwhelming. This is made worse by the fact that a lot of tutorials and documentation out there are designed for software developers and data scientists. I learned how to program myself, and it took me a long time to figure out what was going on. 

**But this tutorial is designed for researchers**. Here, you'll learn the tiny slice of Python that is going to make the biggest difference for your research. Also, I am assuming that you have zero experience with programmming or quantitative data analysis. I expect that if you want to clean, manipulate, describe, or visualize data that you would typically use Excel, Google Sheets, or other similar tools.
